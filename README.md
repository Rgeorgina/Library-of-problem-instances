# Library-of-problem-instances
This repository contains benchmark instances of the two-dimensional strip packing problem (2D-SPP). 
The files "zero-waste-2DSPP-instances" and "non-zero-waste-2DSPP-instances" contain hyperlinks to the text files containing benchmark instances of a variety of authors for the 2D-SPP from the literature.
The files "2DSPP_Instances_ID1to16_Class1to7", named G, and "2DSPP_Instances_MixedClass", named G(m), contain hyperlinks to the text files containing benchmark instances of Rakotonirainy for the paper "Towards a framework for effective packing algorithm selection", generated by the 2DCPackGen problem generator of Silva et al.  
A clustering has been performed of a large, representative set of strip packing benchmark instances from various repositories in the literature into different classes of test problems based on their underlying features. The file "Clustering_of_2D-SPP" contains a brief description of the characteristics of these clustered benchmarks. Lists of benchmarks in each cluster are recorded in the file "Cluster_Lists".
